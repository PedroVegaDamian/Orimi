    <Title> Pedro Vega Damian - Frontend Developer </Title>
    <p className="mb-5">
      I am a specialized Frontend developer, passionate about creating
      exceptional web experiences. My primary focus is mastering key
      technologies like HTML, CSS, and Sass, which allow me to design and style
      attractive and functional user interfaces. With a deep understanding of
      JavaScript and TypeScript, I can implement dynamic functionalities and
      ensure the robustness and scalability of the code.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5">
      I work with modern frameworks such as React, Next, Vue, and Nuxt to
      develop robust and responsive user interfaces. These frameworks enable me
      to create interactive and optimized web applications, ensuring an
      excellent user experience on devices of different sizes and capabilities.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5">
      In addition to my frontend specialization, I have experience with
      server-side technologies like Node.js and Express. This allows me to
      develop and maintain complete web applications, from frontend to backend.
      I am familiar with data management and manipulation using databases such
      as MongoDB and Firebase, which enables me to create applications that can
      efficiently and securely handle large volumes of data.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-5">
      My goal is to continue refining my skills and staying up-to-date with the
      latest trends and technologies in web development, to offer innovative and
      high-quality solutions that meet the needs of users and clients.
