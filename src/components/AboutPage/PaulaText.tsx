        <Title> Paula Villegas Castro - Full Stack Developer </Title>
        <p className="pb-5">
            My name is Paula Villegas Castro, and I am a fullstack developer. My journey in the world of programming began with a frontend bootcamp, where I acquired a solid foundation in web development. My curiosity and desire to learn led me to participate in a project supported by Fundación Telefónica and 42 Madrid, where I was able to expand and refine my skills.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-5">
            My education didn't stop there. I completed a SEPE course in PHP, which included successful internships and secured me a position at the company where I did my internship. This practical experience has been fundamental to my professional development, allowing me to apply my knowledge in a real-world setting.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-5">
            Recently, I completed a master's degree in fullstack development, which has allowed me to master a wide range of technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, React, Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, MongoDB, Jest, Docker, and SQL. These skills enable me to tackle projects both on the client and server sides, providing comprehensive and effective solutions.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-5">
            I want to continue growing in the programming world, which is why I am working on this project with my colleagues. It gives me the opportunity to apply my skills in a collaborative and challenging environment.
