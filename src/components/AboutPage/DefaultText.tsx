    <p className="pb-5">Welcome to Orimi!</p>
    <p className="pb-5">
      Orimi was born out of our desire to challenge ourselves and create a
      project we could be proud of—and we nailed it! We are a team of three
      developers and one QA specialist who came together through the magic of
      Discord and YouTube. Despite being strangers initially, we successfully
      organized and managed our time to put together this amazing and fully
      functional project.
    </p>
    <p className="pb-5">
      Our journey began with planning on Figma and collaborating through
      Discord, seamlessly integrating Jira and GitHub into our workflow. Working
      across three different continents—South America, Europe, and Oceania—our
      work was asynchronous, with daily meetings four days a week at times
      convenient for everyone.
    </p>
    <p className="pb-5">
      We invite you to explore our site: create a profile, update your address,
      check your order history, and buy as many origamis as you like. Don’t
      forget to check out our payment method implementation and maybe even reset
      your password for fun! All functionalities are working—have a play around.
    </p>
    <p className="pb-5">
      Feel free to reach out or make any suggestions—we’re here to listen and
      improve. We hope you enjoy our site as much as we enjoyed creating it.
    </p>
    <p className="pb-5">Thank you for visiting Orimi!</p>
